Laravel Messages is a very simple demo app to show a Messages API integration with Laravel 7. It receives and responds to WhatsApp messages, sends Messages to a whitelisted number, and logs the incoming status events.

We've tried to keep things short and sweet!

* Clone this repo and run `composer install` (requires PHP 7.3+).
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add your credentials to the `NEXMO_*` fields at the bottom.
* Run your application with `php artisan serve`.
* If you're working locally, run [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to expose the port locally; copy the URL.
* On the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), go to the Messages API Sandbox, and whitelist your phone for WhatsApp.
* On the same page, configure the webhook URLs for incoming messages and status events:
    - incoming messages should be `[url you copied earlier]/webhooks/inbound`
    - status webhooks should go to `[url you copied earlier]/webhooks/status`

You're all set!
